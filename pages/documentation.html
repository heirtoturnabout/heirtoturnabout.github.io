    <h1>Documentation:</h1>

    <p>My original sketch design for the website is available here:</p>
    <div id="sketch">
        <img src="../media/Drawing.png" alt="Original website mockup">
    </div>
    
    <p>The biggest difference between the original sketch is the lack of horizontal rules.</p>

    <h2>Design notes</h2>
    <p>I struggled a bit with setting up the design to match the original sketch,
        <br>
        but I feel like what I've created here is a natural compromise.
        <br>
        My main goal with this portfolio is to provide information in a way that's "frills-free."
        <br>
        While I put a lot of effort into the color and font choice,
        <br>
        I intentionally wanted to choose a design that does not obscure information.
        <br>
        Clarity is the number one goal.
    </p>

    <h2>Moving forwards</h2>
    <p>I'd like to potentially add a shrunken down navbar for the mobile version of the page.
        <br>
        In addition, some general formatting fixes would go a long way.
        <br>
        Of course, actually adding in portfoio content is also a priority,
        <br>
        in addition to potentially adding more portfolio spaces for additional projects.
    </p>
