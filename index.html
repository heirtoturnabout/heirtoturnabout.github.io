                    <h2>Designer. Developer. Doer.</h2>  
                    <p>It's a pleasure to meet you! I'm a game designer and developer from Connecticut.
                        <br>
                        I've been programming since high school and am proficient in languages like C#, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to name a few.
                        <br>
                        When I'm not developing them, you can find me playing video games, watching Survivor, reading, or playing with my dog Luke.
                        <br>
                        Let's make something amazing happen by working together.
                        <br>

                        <p>Into the Labyrinth is a game prototype created for my Introduction to Game Development and Algorithmic Problem Solving 2 class at RIT. In my team I was both a programmer and designer, using C# in the MonoGame framework to develop and design the game along four other teammates. Without any starter code, we used Agile development to build the protoype from the ground up. The final prototype was praised by our professor as one of the few working examples of an RPG she had ever seen. In the game itself, players pick one of three characters and face endless battles against the other game characters. We had written stories and created a small world for the characters, drawing on both our technical and creative skills.</p>

                        <p>The "Random Walker" was an individual, in-class project for my Interactive Media Development class at RIT, designed to show my skills with Unity's random modules and Perlin Noise terrain generation, using C# to code the program. On load several models are instantiated, adhering to positional guidelines while still maintaining some natural randomness. The user can then walk around the world and look at the characters up close or change the camera angles.</p>

                        <p>Asteroids was an individual assignment for my Interactive Media Development class at RIT. This assignment, however, covers the areas of Unity 2D game development, collision detection, and random movement, also using C# for development. The user controls a space ship and fires lasers at oncoming Asteroids, aiming to get a high score while surviving as long as possible.</p>

                        <p>The Harvard Art Museums Search website was an individual project for my Intro to Game Web Tech class at RIT. This project tasked us with designing a website that used an API to provide a fun or helpful service. The Harvard Art Museums Search site allows users to search for artwork in Harvard's collections by name, or by searching for general terms and pairing them with filters by culture and classification. We used starter code given to us to build unique web applications, and the site demonstrates my skill with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as an understanding of API technologies.</p>

                        <p>Dueling Detectives is a board game prototype developed as a team project for my Game Design and Development I class at RIT. Using only the idea of "a mystery where your choices matter" as the jumping off point, our team developed a crime based, darkly comedic board game where players race to solve crimes before their opponents. We wrote highly detailed documentation outlining the game's creation and rules, in addition to developing a playable prototype using Roll20. The game received high praise from playtesters and our professor alike, and has been one of the most fun projects I have ever worked on. </p>

                        <p>Into the Labyrinth 2 is a sequel to Into the Labyrinth, another project I had worked on while at RIT. While the former game was a turn-based RPG developed using C# and the MonoGame framework, this web based game is a shoot-'em-up developed using JavaScript and the PIXIJS framework. This was an individual project for my Intro to Game Web Tech class, and I used starter code from a former assignment as the groundwork for the game. There are three playable characters with unique playstyles, over 20 levels between all three characters, and unique endings for each hero.</p>
